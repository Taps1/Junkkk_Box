* It was built for batch jobs, It's probably not useful for near real-time processing
* It doesn't trigger the execution for you, you still need to run the data pipeline (may be via. cronjob)

There are two important topics to understand in Luigi:
	Target and Tasks

The target class corresponds to a file on a disk, Or a file on S3, Or some kind of checkpoint, like an entry in Database.

The only method that Targets have to implement is 'exists'

	class MyTarget(luigi.Target):
    		def exists(self):
        		return True

In practice, implementing Target subclass is rarely needed, I'll mostly use LocalTarget, S3Target or FTPTarget classes, These directly map to a file on local drive, on S3, or in FTP respectively

The Task class is where work gets done in Luigi, With only three methods we need to implement: requires, output, and run.

	import luigi

	class MyExampleTask(luigi.Task):

	    # Example parameter for our task: a 
	    # date for which a report should be run
	    report_date = luigi.DateParameter()

	    def requires(self):
	        """
	        Which other Tasks need to be complete before
	        this Task can start? Luigi will use this to 
	        compute the task dependency graph.
	        """
	        return [MyUpstreamTask(self.report_date)]

	    def output(self):
	        """
	        When this Task is complete, where will it produce output?
	        Luigi will check whether this output (specified as a Target) 
	        exists to determine whether the Task needs to run at all.
	        """
	        return S3Target('s3://my-output-bucket/my-example-tasks-output')

	    def run(self):
        	"""
	        How do I run this Task?
	        Luigi will call this method if the Task needs to be run.
	        """
	        # We can do anything we want in here, from calling python
	        # methods to running shell scripts to calling APIs

The requires() method is used to specify dependencies on other Task objects.

The output() method returns one or more Target objects that point at the output from our Task.

The run() method contains the actual code that is run.

Luigi has built-in checkpointing support. Luigi also ensures that duplicate Tasks don't run simultaneously, protecting you from duplicate outputs

	import luigi

	class PrintNumbers(luigi.Task):
        	def requires(self):
	                return []

        	def output(self):
                	return luigi.LocalTarget("outputs_for_luigi/numbers_upto_10")

	        def run(self):
        	        with self.output().open('w') as f:
                	        for i in range(1, 11):
                        	        f.write("{}\n".format(i))

	class SquaredNumbers(luigi.Task):
        	def requires(self):
                	return [PrintNumbers()]

	        def output(self):
        	        return luigi.LocalTarget("outputs_for_luigi/squares.txt")

	        def run(self):
        	        import pdb;pdb.set_trace()
                	with self.input()[0].open() as fin, self.output().open('w') as fout:
                        for line in fin:
                                n = int(line.strip())
                                out = n*n
                                fout.write("{}: {}\n".format(n, out))

	if __name__ == "__main__":
        	luigi.run()

	python run_luigi.py SquaredNumbers --local-scheduler
	luigi -m run_luigi.py SquaredNumbers --local-scheduler

We can pass the arguments with luigi.Parameter()

	class SquaredNumbers(luigi.Task):
	    n = luigi.IntParameter()

	python run_luigi.py SquaredNumbers --local-scheduler --n 20

Parameters can also have default values
	n = luigi.IntParameter(default=10)

Local VS Global scheduler:
	Using global scheduler in production has 2 advantages:
	* Avoid running two instances of the same task simultaneously
	* Nice web based visualisation

I can run Luigi scheduler daemon in the foreground with:
	$ luigid
Or in the background with:
	$ luigid --background

With the global Luigi scheduler, We can re-run the code without the option for local scheduler:
	$ python run_luigi.py SquaredNumbers --n 20
