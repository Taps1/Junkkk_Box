Development of storage hardware:
	Puch cards were used back then
	Punch tape
	Magnetc Tape
	Spinning Disks
	- Hard Disk
	- Floppy Disk
	Optical Disk
	- CD/DVD/Blu-ray
	Solid state drive(SSD)

A usually a large collection of data organised especially for rapid search and retrieval

Data is stored on one or more tables (composed of rows and columns)
row - tuple
column - attribute

Different types of databases:
	Relational
	Object Oriented
	Document Based

    sudo apt-get --auto-remove purge mysql\*
    sudo apt install mysql-server

In SQL, -- is used for single line comments
/* ... */ is used for multiple line comments

Each table must have one column that can uniquely identify a row is known as Primary key
If more than one table uses the same primary key, we can merge those two tables together, a table can also have a column that is classified as a Foreign key.
A table will have a column which will have values that are primary keys in another table and will be known as Foreign key
A foreign key links that table to another table's primary key

Why not just have one table - 
    We've a Contact database
	First Name, Last Name, Email Addresses
    What if one has got more than 1 email address, we can add email2 but ...
    What if one has more than 5 email address, We can't keep on adding more and more fields for emails like email1, email2, .., 

    A better solution - 
	Make a table which will have Key, FirstName, LastName and let's create another table for email addresses

        PERSON_TABLE                                    EMAIL_TABLE
        ------------------------------                  ------------------------------
        Key    FirstName    LastName                    Key    PersonKey    Email
        1      Jon          Flanders                    1      2            fritz@...
        2      Fritz        Onnion                      2      1            jon1@...
                                                        3      1            job2@...

Here, PersonKey(email_table) is a foreignKey to key(person_table)

Now try to ask - what are all jon's email addresses, how many email addresses does each person has.

    <COMMANDS>
        create database <database_name>;
	use database <database_name>;	
        create table <table_name> (<column_name> <datatype>, <column_name> <datatype>, <column_name> <data_type>, ...);
	select <column_name>, <column_name>, ... from <table_name>;
	select first_name, last_name from person where age BETWEEN 10 and 15;
        select first_name, last_name from person where age IN (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15);
        select first_name, last_name from person where first_name LIKE 'Tal%';
        select first_name from person where last_name IS null; 

    There are two ways to limit the number of rows in a simple SELECT statement
	- Add additional clauses after the from clause
	- Use DISTINCT qualifier before the SELECT list
