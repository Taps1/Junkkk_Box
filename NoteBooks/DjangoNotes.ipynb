    "  - Caching: If Proxy already has response, it returned the response without increasing load on server.\n",
    "- `Reverse Proxy`:(Inbound traffic --> From outside to server) Works from server's side, forwards request from client to server. Accepts the request from client and decides which server it shall forward the request to. Client doesn't know who the actual server is, it's only dealing with reverse proxy.\n",
