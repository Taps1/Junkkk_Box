<black_jack.py>:
I need to create a simple text based BlackJack game
The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer
The Player can stand or hit
The player must be able to pick their betting amount
You need to keep track of the player total money
You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or bursta etc
You must use OOP and classes in some portion of your game, You can not just use functions in your game,
Use classes to help you define the deck and player's hand. There are many right ways to do this,
